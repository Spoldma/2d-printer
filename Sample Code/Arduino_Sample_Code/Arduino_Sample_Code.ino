/* This example code shows how to drive two stepper motors
and a servo in parallel. 

The pin layout is the following:

SERVO - 10

These are the pins that are used to drive the DRV8825 controllers
which in turn control the two stepper motors.

STEPPER1 DIR    - 0
STEPPER1 STEP   - 1 
STEPPER1 ENABLE - 2

STEPPER2 DIR    - 6
STEPPER2 STEP   - 7
STEPPER2 ENABLE - 8

NOTE that these pins can be configured in stepperMotor.cpp as needed.
NOTE also that stepperMotor.cpp has been set up for 1/8 microstepping. Make sure that your DRV8825 setup matches this.
